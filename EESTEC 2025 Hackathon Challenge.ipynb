    "Welcome to the hackathon. Let me introduce you to your tasks. Consider the dataset shown below. It contains political statements from various sources, including public speeches, online posts, and radio shows. Each statement is categorized for its truthfulness, from \"pants-fire,\" meaning the liar was caught red-handed, to \"true.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to build a `lie_detector` function that can categorize statements similar to your dataset but not contained in it as well as possible. Your function may also use the metadata collected with each statement. For further details on the dataset, please refer to the text file in the same subfolder."

Hand in a folder with the name \"team_name\" or \"1stmemberfullname_2ndmemberfullname...\" (e.g. \"Steffen_Stand_In_Emma_Example\") containing only your edited jupyter notebook, a savefile of one machine learning model your function may use and the hackathon dataset. That is 3 files in total (you may additionally keep the README.txt in there). \n",
    "1. Write all code in this jupyter notebook, follow common standards of academic integrity (i.e. mark and cite anything that is not your contribution), and only use publicly available resources.\n",
    "1. You may train a neural network (or similar) during the hackathon, save it in your submission folder, and load it into your lie detector function. If you do so, only train the model on the provided dataset. Also, provide the training loop in your submitted notebook. It needs to be able to recreate and overwrite your saved model (plus minus differently initialized weights). (This is needed to prove that you did not use our test data to train your model.)\n",
    "1. Submit your folder before the end of the hackathon, any later submission will be ignored. "

Your lie detector function is graded on the mean squared error (of these truthfulness scores) achieved on our test dataset. Your lie detector function needs to fulfill the following three criteria as well:\n",

    "1. Take the inputs as defined below.\n",
    "1. Return a string of the statement's label seen in the dataset.\n",

    "1. Detecting lies is a hard task, do your best, and don't worry if your lie detector is not super accurate.\n",
    "1. Statistical methods and different types of neural networks have been shown to perform not too badly on this task. You may even combine them.\n",
    "1. Your lie detector may encounter new speakers, States, or locations during grading. Make sure it can handle these.\n",
    "1. Make sure your submitted notebook runs with a reset kernel using only the originally provided dataset file. \n",
